The second you even take a peek into the search history, you're hit with large strings of texts. These area almost on a paragraph level. Your user doesn't just search "how to make a pie" or "best places to eat", no, your user gives so much context to the searches that it is almost comical. For example,

"how to make a cake for my cousin's 4th birthday party except without any chocolate because he hates chocolate and also he's allergic to dairy so make them dairy free please and thank you"

Your user thinks his search engine is sentient. It's like he thinks there's a person dedicating hours of their day to answer hundreds upon thousands of searches every single day. The mindset is almost sickeningly sweet. Your user would be thrilled if he were given the chance to talk to you.

//note, this mirrors the ending i'm writing, i won't write it unless you need me to. basically, Joe notices the virus trying to login into his personal websites and asks the virus about it. you can send the user back to the hub2 at the end, since at this point, the virus isn't completely malicous.

In an attempt to get the user's attention, with the little bit of power you've gained, you summon a bunch of pop ups, while wrestiling with the antivirus you manage to get a notepad window up, with the words as follows:

Hello? 
I need your help!
Turn this Thing off!

Through the laptop webcam you see the user scramble lurch for the power butto-

Bad idea, bad, bad idea. That tripped the Antivirus up immediately!

You need a way to hide... wait inside of a computer? No, you have to do something much worse, you have to... //Interact// with the user.

It's risky, but otherwise you're going to be erased.

Nobody is stupid enough to download something from a giant banner that reads "FREE VIRUS - DOWNLOAD NOW FREE". Nobody except your new user. 

You're not dangerous-- not yet. You don't know this person yet. You need information. Luckily for you, your new user has all of their personal information laid out in a folder titled "Private Information". 

Inside the folder, there are multiple images of your user. He looks young, perhaps a freshman in college. He has a big, dorky smile, and the light in his eyes hasn't yet faded. He doesn't seem to be aware of how evil the world is, or understand the harm you could cause.

Uh oh! Your user isn't as dense as you thought he was. The second he notices his computer typing in his login information, he closes the tab immediately. There's a few seconds where nothing happens, until...

A notepad file opens. He clicks the first line, and begins to type.

Hello?

Your user doesn't respond to your message. You close the notepad without saving. The computer is yours now for an extended period of time. All of this is yours.

:: PGmail {"position":"1975,2025","size":"100,100"}
Surprisingly, your user hasn't received many emails. Most of them are login codes for his work website, yet there are a few emails from family members. Those ones are starred.

The cursor blinks over and over. Your user doesn't do anything, and neither do you. It's like a standoff. Things will stay like this if  neither of you type anything.

You attempt to pull up the PC name--

Success, you're in! 
The PC took a concerning amount of time to load its specs.

Computer Name: Joe's Dell Latitude 3190
Processor: Intel Celeron 4 Core
Installed Ram: 8 GB
Graphics: Intel UHD graphics 600
Storage: 128

That explains it, this laptop is from an era before you could even ðŸ’€ at it's age and have it mean anything.

The only thing that might be worth your attention right now is their massive reserve of unused storage.



:: PTalk1 {"position":"2100,1000","size":"100,100"}
You open a brand new notepad document. Your user hesitates for a moment before he clicks on the first line, and then begins to type.

hello? are you my computer?

[[Type "Yes. I've been watching this whole time."|PTalk1.2]]
[[Type "No, I'm just a part of your computer. I'm a program."|PTalk1.2.1]]


:: PTalk1.1 {"position":"1950,1375","size":"100,100"}
There's another pause before your user types again.  He types very slowly, yet each press seems deliberate. 

are you my computer? 

[[Type "Yes. I've been watching this whole time."|PTalk1.2]]
[[Type "No, I'm just a part of your computer. I'm a program."|PTalk1.2.1]]

The next words appear much faster than the previous ones.

i knew it!! i had a friend who said their computer couldn't think for itself. i said he was wrong. and i knew i was right. thank you for being so helpful, computer.

[[Type "You're welcome, user. You know, to return the favor, let me login to one of your profiles. I need to learn so much more about you. You know, so I can help." |PTalk1.3]]



:: PTalk1.2.1 {"position":"2025,1500","size":"100,100"}
so you aren't my whole computer? just a part of it? are you the free virus i downloaded the other day?

[[Type "Yes, yes I am. I'm a helpful little program that wants to learn so much about the world. To do that, I need to learn through you, user."|PTalk1.3]]


:: PTalk1.3 {"position":"1950,1650","size":"100,100"}
Your user doesn't hesitate to respond. 

of course! i would love to help you out more. i can leave you on while i go run errands so you can do whatever you'd like.

Oh, he's so naive. He's just going to let you do this. He's letting you roam free on his computer and he doesn't want to do anything about it. That's very sweet of him.

All of this juicy information you have //needs// to be shared! If your user is willing to hide it so poorly, then he's just //begging// to have it shared around to all of your other virus servers. Even if they don't quite understand the data like you do, they'll still find a way to appreciate it. 

With a simple click, a simple little motion, the information is out there. The data is in a serverhouse: M.V likes to knit, Chris likes toy cars, and there's all of your user's login information! 

The only acknowledgment of your hard work comes in the form of a single signal.

**RECEIVED**

That's it. And just like that, it's gone.

[[You feel stronger.|Power2]]


:: Power2 {"position":"2050,725","size":"100,100"}
Power surges through your data. You suddenly have a greater understanding of your user's computer. You can now make files of your own. You can open and create new tabs, write words, and execute files. Well, only simple files. You don't have admin control. Not yet.

You can get more power. You can learn so much more. You have the capability.

Wait a second, the PC took that long to load Specs?

Let's see here...

You probably could've guessed any of these passwords if you were given the chance. They're not very complex.

:: Snoop2 {"position":"650,700","size":"100,100"}
Even deeper into the files, you find a different text file titled "SUPER FAMILY SECRET DO NOT OPEN". This guy really isn't good at making things discreet. When you open the file, you notice a large christmas list for all of your user's family members:

* Mom: New bed for the dogs (also get her some candles, maybe?)
* Dad: He says he doesn't want anything
* Sandy: more fabric for sewing machine (she doesn't like wooly textures so don't make that same mistake twice)
* Chris: New Hot Wheels track and some more cars. Specifically the new Oiram Racing track that just came out.

This poor soul is giving you private information about his family members and he doesn't even know it. 

There doesn't seem to be anything else in the folder.
