The second you even take a peek into the search history, you're hit with large strings of texts. These area almost on a paragraph level. Your user doesn't just search "how to make a pie" or "best places to eat", no, your user gives so much context to the searches that it is almost comical. For example,

"how to make a cake for my cousin's 4th birthday party except without any chocolate because he hates chocolate and also he's allergic to dairy so make them dairy free please and thank you"

Your user thinks his search engine is sentient. It's like he thinks there's a person dedicating hours of their day to answer hundreds upon thousands of searches every single day. The mindset is almost sickeningly sweet. Your user would be thrilled if he were given the chance to talk to you.

//note, this mirrors the ending i'm writing, i won't write it unless you need me to. basically, Joe notices the virus trying to login into his personal websites and asks the virus about it. you can send the user back to the hub2 at the end, since at this point, the virus isn't completely malicous.

In an attempt to get the user's attention, with the little bit of power you've gained, you summon a bunch of pop ups, while wrestiling with the antivirus you manage to get a notepad window up, with the words as follows:

Hello? 
I need your help!
Turn this Thing off!

Through the laptop webcam you see the user scramble lurch for the power butto-

Bad idea, bad, bad idea. That tripped the Antivirus up immediately!

You need a way to hide... wait inside of a computer? No, you have to do something much worse, you have to... //Interact// with the user.

It's risky, but otherwise you're going to be erased.

Nobody is stupid enough to download something from a giant banner that reads "FREE VIRUS - DOWNLOAD NOW FREE". Nobody except your new user. 

You're not dangerous-- not yet. You don't know this person yet. You need information. Luckily for you, your new user has all of their personal information laid out in a folder titled "Private Information". 

Inside the folder, there are multiple images of your user. He looks young, perhaps a freshman in college. He has a big, dorky smile, and the light in his eyes hasn't yet faded. He doesn't seem to be aware of how evil the world is, or understand the harm you could cause.

Uh oh! Your user isn't as dense as you thought he was. The second he notices his computer typing in his login information, he closes the tab immediately. There's a few seconds where nothing happens, until...

A notepad file opens. He clicks the first line, and begins to type.

Through your user's facebook login, you finally learn his name: Joesph V. Somehow, his last name is a single letter. 

His Facebook feed is rather normal. As you scroll, you can only find various food recipes, cute animal videos, and sometimes a DIY craft tutorial that ends up making something completely useless.

You also notice he has multiple messages open with a Janice V, a Jared V, and a Sandy Vee.

Your user didn't fail to forget anything on his user profile. Every little category has been filled out. His profile photo is a professional headshot. He's wearing a white button up and a blue tie with a checkered pattern on it. His dorky smile practially stretchse across his face. His profile banner is a stock photo of the ocean. You can still see the watermark on it.

Underneath his profile photo, there is more information:

*Account Manager at Big Bank Inc
*Born on September 7h, 2003
*From Brainerd, Minnesota
*Not in a relationship

His posts are relatively normal. They are all old pictures of him and his parents with long sappy messages about how much he loves them and how much of an inspiration they are to him.

Success, you're in! 
The PC took a concerning amount of time to load its specs.

Computer Name: Joe's Dell Latitude 3190
Processor: Intel Celeron 4 Core
Installed Ram: 8 GB
Graphics: Intel UHD graphics 600
Storage: 128

That explains it, this laptop is from an era before you could even 💀 at it's age and have it mean anything.

The only thing that might be worth your attention right now is their massive reserve of unused storage. That means there's lots more room for creating your own files.

You open a brand new notepad document. Your user hesitates for a moment before he clicks on the first line, and then begins to type.

Your user doesn't hesitate to respond. 

of course! i would love to help you out more. i can leave you on while i go run errands so you can do whatever you'd like.

Oh, he's so naive. He's just going to let you do this. He's letting you roam free on his computer and he doesn't want to do anything about it. That's very sweet of him.

Before you enter officially, the website asks to verify your login via  code sent to your user's email. It's good to know there's some level of security with this place. After you input the code, you're in.

This website hasn't been updated in a long, long time. The interface is just a little bit too small, the buttons sometimes lead to broken webpages; however, the most important button still works; ***Acesses Accounts***.

Your user manages a number accounts for this bank. With a simple click, you can see hundreds of names, dollar amounts,, routing numbers, passwords, emails-- it's limitless. You have it all.

With a simple click, a simple little motion, the information is out there. The data is in a serverhouse: M.V likes to knit, Chris likes toy cars, and there's all of your user's login information! 

The only acknowledgment of your hard work comes in the form of a single signal.

* Dad: He says he doesn't want anything
* Sandy: more fabric for sewing machine (she doesn't like wooly textures so don't make that same mistake twice)
* Chris: New Hot Wheels track and some more cars. Specifically the new Oiram Racing track that just came out.
