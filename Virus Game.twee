The second you even take a peek into the search history, you're hit with large strings of texts. These area almost on a paragraph level. Your user doesn't just search "how to make a pie" or "best places to eat", no, your user gives so much context to the searches that it is almost comical. For example,

"how to make a cake for my cousin's 4th birthday party except without any chocolate because he hates chocolate and also he's allergic to dairy so make them dairy free please and thank you"

Your user thinks his search engine is sentient. It's like he thinks there's a person dedicating hours of their day to answer hundreds upon thousands of searches every single day. The mindset is almost sickeningly sweet. Your user would be thrilled if he were given the chance to talk to you.

[[Look at frequently visited websites. |Browser2]]

In an attempt to get the user's attention, with the little bit of power you've gained, you summon a bunch of pop ups, while wrestiling with the antivirus you manage to get a notepad window up, with the words as follows:

Hello? 
I need your help!
Turn this Thing off!

Through the laptop webcam you see the user scramble lurch for the power butto-

you've been [[erased?|Reboot1]]

Bad idea, bad, bad idea. That tripped the Antivirus up immediately!

You need a way to hide... wait inside of a computer? No, you have to do something much worse, you have to... //Interact// with the user.

It's risky, but otherwise you're going to be erased.


[[Take the risk. |Chat]]

Unfortunately for you you don't have Kernel-level access yet, but the antivirus does, it immediately takes advantage of your state and disables your processes, dropping you into quarantine for deletion

[You've been erased.]

You've successfully depleted the personal information folder for all of its natural resources. What a true pioneer you are! Although- what good is a pioneer if he doesn't look for more worlds to conquer?

Nobody is stupid enough to download something from a giant banner that reads "FREE VIRUS - DOWNLOAD NOW FREE". Nobody except your new user. 

You're not dangerous-- not yet. You don't know this person yet. You need information. Luckily for you, your new user has all of their personal information laid out in a folder titled "Private Information". 

Inside the folder, there are multiple images of your user. He looks young, perhaps a freshman in college. He has a big, dorky smile, and the light in his eyes hasn't yet faded. He doesn't seem to be aware of how evil the world is, or understand the harm you could cause.

sell information gain power
route from here gives ability to communicate with user through text files
can also now search things on the web and create facebook posts and send emails
this might also be able to be obtained later

All of this juicy information you have //needs// to be shared! If your user is willing to hide it so poorly, then he's just //begging// to have it shared around to all of your other virus servers. Even if they don't quite understand the data like you do, they'll still find a way to appreciate it. 

With a simple click, a simple little motion, the information is out there. The data is in a serverhouse: M.V likes to knit, Chris likes toy cars, and there's all of your user's login information! 

The only acknowledgment of your hard work comes in the form of a single signal.

**RECEIVED**

That's it. And just like that, it's gone.

Success, You're in! 
wait a sec, the PC took that long to load Specs?

let's see here...

Computer Name: Dell Latitude 3190
Processor: Intel Celeron 4 Core
Installed Ram: 8 GB
Graphics: Intel UHD graphics 600
Storage: 128

That explains it, this laptop is from an era before you could even ðŸ’€ at it's age and have it mean anything.
 the only thing that might be worth your attention right now is their massive reserve of unused storage.
Or... you could try to get into the control panel?

Deeper into the folder, hidden underneath all of the family photos, lies every single password your user has. All 4 of them, stored into one text file.

''Computer Password: important123''

''Email and Password: myemail22@gmail.com Password 321important''

''Job Login Password: jv8714''

''Facebook email and password: myemail22@gmail.com Password: ilovemyfamily231''

You probably could've guessed any of these passwords if you were given the chance. They're not very complex.

[[Go deeper. Find more. |Snoop2]]

Even deeper into the files, you find a different text file titled "SUPER FAMILY SECRET DO NOT OPEN". This guy really isn't good at making things discreet. When you open the file, you notice a large christmas list for all of your user's family members:

* Mom: New bed for the dogs (also get her some candles, maybe?)
* Dad: He says he doesn't want anything
* Sandy: more fabric for sewing machine (she doesn't like wooly textures so don't make that same mistake twice)
* Chris: New Hot Wheels track and some more cars. Specifically the new Oiram Racing track that just came out.

This poor soul is giving you private information about his family members and he doesn't even know it. 

There doesn't seem to be anything else in the folder.
