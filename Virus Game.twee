The second you even take a peek into the search history, you're hit with large strings of texts. These area almost on a paragraph level. Your user doesn't just search "how to make a pie" or "best places to eat", no, your user gives so much context to the searches that it is almost comical. For example,

"how to make a cake for my cousin's 4th birthday party except without any chocolate because he hates chocolate and also he's allergic to dairy so make them dairy free please and thank you"

Your user thinks his search engine is sentient. It's like he thinks there's a person dedicating hours of their day to answer hundreds upon thousands of searches every single day. The mindset is almost sickeningly sweet. Your user would be thrilled if he were given the chance to talk to you.

In an attempt to get the user's attention, with the little bit of power you've gained, you summon a bunch of pop ups, while wrestiling with the antivirus you manage to get a notepad window up, with the words as follows:

Hello? 
I need your help!

Through the laptop webcam you see the user scramble lurch for the power butto-

Bad idea, bad, bad idea. That tripped the Antivirus up immediately!

It's risky, but otherwise you're going to be erased.

Nobody is stupid enough to download something from a giant banner that reads "FREE VIRUS - DOWNLOAD NOW FREE". Nobody except your new user. 

You're not dangerous-- not yet. You don't know this person yet. You need information. Luckily for you, your new user has all of their personal information laid out in a folder titled "Private Information". 

Inside the folder, there are multiple images of your user. He looks young, perhaps a freshman in college. He has a big, dorky smile, and the light in his eyes hasn't yet faded. He doesn't seem to be aware of how evil the world is, or understand the harm you could cause.

Uh oh! Your user isn't as dense as you thought he was. The second he notices his computer typing in his login information, he closes the tab immediately. There's a few seconds where nothing happens, until...

A notepad file opens. He clicks the first line, and begins to type.

Through your user's facebook login, you finally learn his name: Joesph V. Somehow, his last name is a single letter. 

His Facebook feed is rather normal. As you scroll, you can only find various food recipes, cute animal videos, and sometimes a DIY craft tutorial that ends up making something completely useless.

You also notice he has multiple messages open with a Janice V, a Jared V, and a Sandy Vee.

Your user doesn't respond to your message. You close the notepad without saving. The computer is yours now for an extended period of time. All of this is yours.

:: PGmail {"position":"2300,2025","size":"100,100"}
Surprisingly, your user hasn't received many emails. Most of them are login codes for his work website, yet there are a few emails from family members. Those ones are starred.

[[**Janice V** My boy's first ever email...|PMomEmail]]
[[**Jared V** Grocery list|PDadEmail]]
[[Look at other websites.|PBrowserHub]]


:: PMessages {"position":"2050,2250","size":"100,100"}
Looking through the messages, you gather that Janice V is your user's mother, and Jared V is your user's father. Sandy Vee is his cousin that he is close with. 

Janice sends lots of pictures of dogs and many sappy messages about how much she loves your user and how proud she is. From the images, you can tell that Janice owns three dogs, Connie the chuihaha, Mutt the bulldog, and Cocoa the daschund. She talks about them as much as she does her own son. Your user sends just as sappy messages to her.

Jared's messages are few and far between. Sometimes he'll go on a sending spree of messages, which are mostly him asking about what your user has been up to. Sometimes he asks where certain things in the house are. Your user only ever replied in short messages.

Finally, Sandy Vee. Your user and Sandy only ever send each other funny videos. Most of the ones your user sends involve animals, while Sandy sends epic fail compiliations. 

There isn't a lot to be concerned about here.

The email is from a janicev232@gmail.com . The subject line reads "My boy's very first email..."

* Dear Joe, it's been so hard watching you grow up. I remember when you were just born, and you were no bigger than Lassie. You don't remember Lassie much, but she helped me and your father raise you when you were a toddler. I think a lot of her spirit went into you. You're nice, kind, and always willing to help out. Just like Lassie did... and now you're all grown up and working your very own computer. Your dear old mom is still trying to figure this whole thing out. I'm hoping this email actually reaches your mailbox. Love you always, Mom.

How sweet.

This doesn't tell you much though.

The cursor blinks over and over. Your user doesn't do anything, and neither do you. It's like a standoff. Things will stay like this if  neither of you type anything.

[[Type "Hello."|PTalk1.1]]



:: PProfile {"position":"1850,2250","size":"100,100"}
Your user didn't fail to forget anything on his user profile. Every little category has been filled out. His profile photo is a professional headshot. He's wearing a white button up and a blue tie with a checkered pattern on it. His dorky smile practially stretchse across his face. His profile banner is a stock photo of the ocean. You can still see the watermark on it.

Underneath his profile photo, there is more information:

*Account Manager at Big Bank Inc
*Born on September 7h, 2003
*From Brainerd, Minnesota
*Not in a relationship

His posts are relatively normal. They are all old pictures of him and his parents with long sappy messages about how much he loves them and how much of an inspiration they are to him.

Computer Name: Joe's Dell Latitude 3190

That explains it, this laptop is from an era before you could even 💀 at it's age and have it mean anything.

The only thing that might be worth your attention right now is their massive reserve of unused storage. That means there's lots more room for creating your own files.

Your user doesn't hesitate to respond. 

of course! i would love to help you out more. i can leave you on while i go run errands so you can do whatever you'd like.

Oh, he's so naive. He's just going to let you do this. He's letting you roam free on his computer and he doesn't want to do anything about it. That's very sweet of him.

You immediately send out all of the information to a wider server. You can feel the power surging through your code. The feeling is almost overwhelming. All of the power is being directly sent to your small file size. 

You're going to overload yourself if you don't do something soon.

[[Duplicate yourself.|PUFinale2]]


:: PUFinale2 {"position":"2000,3125","size":"100,100"}
Like a cell, you create an identical version of yourself. Your clone does the same. Soon, there are hundreds of you all throughout the user's computer. Each version of yourself covers the ground you couldn't. One of you gains the bright idea to write emails and messages to everyone Joe is in contact with. Some of you hop into the emails and messages to be sent away.

You're too large for the poor antivirus in Joe's computer to stop. There's too many of you. It's way too late. In the swarm of copies of yourself, you can see your user receive emails from his employer about a largescale data breach.

This all feels so good. The power doesn't stop flowing. This high is better than the last high.

[[A notepad opens.|PUFinale3]]


:: PUFinale3 {"position":"2000,3250","size":"100,100"}
Joe frantically begins to write on the first file line.

The words sprawl across the screen so fast that Joe can't even type anything else. He closes the notepad tab. He opens a new search tab in the midst of it all. He searches

"how  to stop virus qucik easy fast help"

He frantically goes through each webpage. Not one of your clones try to stop Joe. You don't think he can do it. Besides, it's already too late. The damage has been done, what can he do?

[[A clone is uninstalled.|PUFinale5]]



:: PUFinale5 {"position":"2000,3500","size":"100,100"}
Then another. And another. And another. Your clones are dropping like flies, and the information is being lost with them. Whatever Joe installed is absolutely wiping them out. You can't even do anything-- the program has stopped everything besides itself from running. It executes all of the clones so quickly you can hardly acknowledge it.

You watch as the program reads scan complete. 

You're free to do something now.

Well, if you could.

You created so many clones that you no longer have the ability to execute any file on your own.

You have to wait for Joe to click on you again. If he ever does.

Deeper into the folder, hidden underneath all of the family photos, lies every single password your user has. All 4 of them, stored into one text file.


''Computer Password: important123''

''Email and Password: myemail22@gmail.com Password 321important''

''Job Login Password: jv8714''

''Facebook email and password: myemail22@gmail.com Password: ilovemyfamily231''

You probably could've guessed any of these passwords if you were given the chance. They're not very complex.

Even deeper into the files, you find a different text file titled "SUPER FAMILY SECRET DO NOT OPEN". This guy really isn't good at making things discreet. When you open the file, you notice a large christmas list for all of your user's family members:

* Mom: New bed for the dogs (also get her some candles, maybe?)
* Dad: He says he doesn't want anything
* Sandy: more fabric for sewing machine (she doesn't like wooly textures so don't make that same mistake twice)
* Chris: New Hot Wheels track and some more cars. Specifically the new Oiram Racing track that just came out.

This poor soul is giving you private information about his family members and he doesn't even know it. 

There doesn't seem to be anything else in the folder.
